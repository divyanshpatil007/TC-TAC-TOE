This Python code implements a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using a dictionary to represent the game board. The board is displayed using print statements, and players input their moves by specifying the location they want to mark ('X' or 'O'). The game checks for a winner after every move by comparing the symbols in the winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals). If there's a winner or the board is full without a winner, the game ends. Players have the option to restart the game.

The code structure is modular, with functions for printing the board, managing the game flow, and checking for a winner. It uses a loop to iterate through the game turns until there's a winner or the board is full. If the game ends, it prompts the players if they want to play again. The board state is reset for a new game if players choose to continue. This code provides a concise and interactive implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.
